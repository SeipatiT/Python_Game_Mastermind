# Python_Game_Mastermind

A game wherein a user must guess a random password. 
This is a school project where I showcased my knowledge of new python concepts (i.e. if statements, for loops etc.)

The user has 12 tries to guess a password correctly. 
They will be told whether they have corrected the correct digits and whether they are in the correct position
